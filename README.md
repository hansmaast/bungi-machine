## Tools

Made using [**React**](https://react.dev/), sounds triggered by [**Tone.js**](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js), minimal styles from [**Styled Components**](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [**styled-system**](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system), PWA support from [**Workbox**](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox). 

## Demo
Take a look at this video where I'm playing around with the bungi. 
Please note that I recorded this without hearing the sounds it produced. 
The sound is very raw, without a balanced mix, and the pattern is quite messy.

Here's a quick demo of the basic menu.

## Further development

This project was initiated for learning and experimenting with the tools mentioned above. 

No further development will continue.
